# ParallelUniverse
Pretty much finished, if not finished.

Each layer in the map is considered a "universe."
Default layer is universe 0, layer 1 is universe 1, layer 2 is universe 2, etc.

The visiblity of notes will depend on which universe they are in.
Universes are divided into one million ms (16.67 min) equivalent segments in position.

The "Update Layer" button adds SVs so that notes in the selected layer are moved to the correct universe.

The "Restore Layer" button removes the SVs.

"Update All" and "Restore All" do the logical thing to do (probably).

The teleport buttons add SVs to teleport between universes.

The "Clean SVs" button removes redundant SVs

The "Place Teleport Earlier" toggle determines whether a teleport starts or ends at a selected note.
The "Adjust Layer Visibility" toggle changes the visibility of layers in the editor to reflect gameplay.
